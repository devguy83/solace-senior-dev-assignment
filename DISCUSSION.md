## Overview

This assignment involved improving a full-stack Next.js application that lists and filters advocate profiles. The goals were to fix bugs, clean up anti-patterns, improve the UI/UX using Tailwind CSS, and address performance issues for scalability. Below are the changes I implemented and what I would improve further with more time.

## Initial Fixes (Bug Cleanup)

### 1. React Hydration Error
The original HTML placed `<th>` elements directly inside `<thead>`, which caused a mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-rendered DOM. This violates HTML standards and caused a hydration failure. It was resolved by wrapping `<th>` elements inside a `<tr>`.

### 2. Missing Key Warnings
React requires a `key` prop for elements in a list to efficiently track updates. The `<tr>` elements and specialties `<div>` children were missing keys, causing console warnings. This has been fixed by using either `advocate.id`, `advocate.phoneNumber`, or array indices (as fallback).

### 3. Fix TypeError for `includes` on non-string
While filtering, `advocate.yearsOfExperience.includes(searchTerm)` threw an error because `yearsOfExperience` is a number. This was resolved by converting it to a string using `.toString()` before applying `.includes()`.

## UI/UX Improvements

- Replaced all inline styles with Tailwind CSS for consistency and scalability.
- Styled the advocate table with:
  - Header row highlighting
  - Alternating background colors for rows
  - Hover effects for better visual feedback
- Improved layout of the search form with padding, spacing, labels, and responsive sizing.
- Added an empty state for when no advocates match the search query.

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Backend-Side Filtering
- Moved filtering logic from the frontend to the backend to support scalability with large datasets.
- Introduced a query parameter `q` (e.g., `/api/advocates?q=social`) which the backend uses to return filtered data.

### 2. Debounced Search
- Added debounced input handling using `lodash.debounce` to avoid firing a request with every keystroke.

### 3. Result Limiting
- Capped the number of returned advocates to 25 per request to simulate pagination and prevent excessive data loading.

Thanks for the opportunity to work on this. It was fun digging into a real-world full-stack Next.js app, and Iâ€™d be excited to contribute even further in a team setting!
